NWSL Analytics Engine - Advanced Sabermetrics-Inspired Intelligence Foundation
================================================================================

This is the unified intelligence system that powers all MCP tools with sophisticated
analytics based on sabermetrics principles from Jim Albert's research.

Core Philosophy:
- Move beyond basic counting stats to predictive, context-adjusted metrics
- Implement composite measures that correlate with team success
- Provide consistent analytical sophistication across all tools
- Focus on insights that drive strategic decisions

Key Metrics System:
- NWSL Impact Rating (NIR): Composite metric combining attacking, defensive, progression
- Context adjustments for opposition strength, team quality, game state
- Predictive indicators tested through year-over-year correlation analysis
- Historical percentile benchmarking for relative performance assessment
