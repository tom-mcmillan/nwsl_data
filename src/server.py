NWSL Advanced Analytics Intelligence Server
=========================================

Sophisticated MCP server powered by sabermetrics-inspired analytics engine.
Transformed from basic statistical reporting to advanced intelligence platform.

Core Philosophy:
- Advanced composite metrics (NWSL Impact Rating) instead of basic counting stats
- Context-adjusted performance analysis (opposition strength, game state)
- Predictive indicators tested through year-over-year correlation
- Unified analytical sophistication across all tools

Based on Jim Albert's sabermetrics research - moving beyond batting average to OPS-level insights.
