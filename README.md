## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Access
The main database is located at `data/processed/nwsldata.db`. Key tables:
- `match_player_summary` - Individual player match statistics
- `match` - Match information and metadata  
- `player` - Player profiles and identities
- `team` - Team information across seasons

### Processing New Data
```bash
# Check HTML file availability
python scripts/html_checkers/check_2024_html_files.py

# Process a complete season
python scripts/seasonal_processors/process_2024_season.py

# Core statistical extraction
python scripts/populate_match_player_summary_2018.py [match_id]
```

### Analysis and Queries
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/processed/nwsldata.db')

# Example: Top scorers across all seasons
query = """
SELECT player_name, SUM(goals) as total_goals, COUNT(*) as matches
FROM match_player_summary 
WHERE goals IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY player_name 
ORDER BY total_goals DESC 
LIMIT 10
"""
```
